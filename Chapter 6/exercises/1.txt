1. Find the value of quack after each line.
          int quack = 2)|
          quack += 5; 7
          quack *= 10; 70
          quack -= 6; 64
          quack /= 8; 8
          quack %= 3; 2

2. Given that value is an int, what output would the following loop produce? 

for ( value = 36; value > 0; value /= 21.
    printf("%3d", value);

    1 

3. Represent each of the following test conditions:
    a. x is greater than 5.

    while (x > 5)

    b. scanf() attempts to read a single double (called x) and fails.

    while (scanf("%lf, &x) != 1)

    c. x has the value 5.

    while (x == 5)

4. Represent each of the following test conditions:
    a. scanf() succeeds in reading a single integer.

    while(scanf(%d, &x) == 1)

    b. x is not 5.

    while (x != 5
    )
    c. x is 20 or greater.

    while (x >= 20)

5. You suspect that the following program is not perfect. What errors can you find?

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{ 
 int i, j, list[10]; /* line 4 */
 for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) /* line 6 */
 { 
    list[i] = 2*i + 3; /* line 8 */
    for (j = 1; j > = i; j++) /* line 9 */
        printf(" %d", list[j]); /* line 10 */
        printf("\n"); /* line 11 */
} /* line 12 */
