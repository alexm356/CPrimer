1. Find the value of quack after each line.
          int quack = 2)|
          quack += 5;
          quack *= 10;
          quack -= 6;
          quack /= 8;
          quack %= 3;

2. Given that value is an int, what output would the following loop produce? for ( value = 36; value > 0; value /= 21.
printf("%3d", value);

3. Represent each of the following test conditions:
    a. x is greater than 5.
    b. scanf() attempts to read a single double (called x) and fails.
    c. x has the value 5.

4. Represent each of the following test conditions:
    a. scanf() succeeds in reading a single integer.
    b. x is not 5.
    c. x is 20 or greater.

5. You suspect that the following program is not perfect. What errors can you find?

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{ 
 int i, j, list[10]; /* line 4 */
 for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) /* line 6 */
 { 
    list[i] = 2*i + 3; /* line 8 */
    for (j = 1; j > = i; j++) /* line 9 */
        printf(" %d", list[j]); /* line 10 */
        printf("\n"); /* line 11 */
} /* line 12 */
