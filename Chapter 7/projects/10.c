/*
The 1988 United States Federal Tax Schedule was the simplest in recent times. It
had four categories, and each category had two rates. Here is a summary (dollar
amounts are taxable income):
Category Tax
Single 15% of first $17,850 plus 28% of excess
Head of Household 15% of first $23,900 plus 28% of excess
Married, Joint 15% of first $29,750 plus 28% of excess
Married, Separate 15% of first $14,875 plus 28% of excess
For example, a single wage earner with a taxable income of $20,000 dollars owes
0.15 x $17,850 + 0.28 x ($20,000â€“$17,850). Write a program that lets the user
specify the tax category and the taxable income and that then calculates the tax.
Use a loop so that the user can enter several tax cases.
