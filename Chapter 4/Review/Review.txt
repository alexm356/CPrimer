1. program ends early. the input reaches a whitespace which it does not expect, and only recognizes first 4 letters of input.

2.

a.
b. printf("He sold the painting for $%2.2f.\n", 2.345e2); $02.35
c.
d.
e. printf("%c%c%c\n", 'H', 105, '\41');
f.
g.
h. #define Q "His Hamlet was funny without being vulgar."
i. printf("%s\nhas %d characters.\n", Q, strlen(Q));
j.
k.
l. printf("Is %2.2e the same as %2.2f?\n", 1201.0, 1201.0);
//1.20e+03

//1201.00
4.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define B "booboo"
#define X 10

int main(void)
{
 int age;
 char name[X];

 printf("Please enter your first name.");
 scanf("%s", name);
 printf("All right, %c, what's your age?\n", name);
 scanf("%d", &age);
 int xp = age + X;
 printf("That's a %s! You must be at least %d.\n", B, xp);
 rerun 0;
}

5.Suppose a program starts as follows:

#define BOOK "War and Peace"

int main(void)
{
 float cost =12.99;
 float percent = 80.0;

 6.What conversion specification would you use to print each of the following?

a. A decimal integer with a field width equal to the number of digits 


b. A hexadecimal integer in the form 8A in a field width of 4


c. A floating-point number in the form 232.346 with a field width of 10


d. A floating-point number in the form 2.33e+002 with a field width of 12


e. A string left-justified in a field of width 30

7.Which conversion specification would you use to print each of the following?
a. An unsigned long integer in a field width of 15
b. A hexadecimal integer in the form 0x8a in a field width of 4
c. A floating-point number in the form 2.33E+02 that is left-justified in a field
width of 12
d. A floating-point number in the form +232.346 in a field width of 10
e. The first eight characters of a string in a field eight characters wide

8.What conversion specification would you use to print each of the following?
a. A decimal integer having a minimum of four digits in a field width of 6
b. An octal integer in a field whose width will be given in the argument list
c. A character in a field width of 2
d. A floating-point number in the form +3.13 in a field width equal to the
number of characters in the number
e. The first five characters in a string left-justified in a field of width 7

9.For each of the following input lines, provide a scanf() statement to read it. Also
declare any variables or arrays used in the statement
a. 101
b. 22.32 8.34Eâ€“09
c. linguini
d. catch 22
e. catch 22 (but skip over catch)

10. What is whitespace?

11.Suppose that you would rather use parentheses than braces in your programs.
How well would the following work?
#define ( {
#define ) }
